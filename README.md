# ci-dockerfiles
A collection of convenience dockerfiles used in various CI pipelines.
Currently, I have some repos containing only one dockerfile. I plan to collect them here.

Built using https://circleci.com and pushed to https://hub.docker.com.

For each subfolder, one image will be generated. The README within the resp. folder is used as README on docker hub. For details on how the images are build, refer to `build.sh`

- TODO: Try w/ github package registry
